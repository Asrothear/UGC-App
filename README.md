# UGC-App
 
This is the successor of the EDMC Plugin "UGC Plugin"  
The UGC App is a Standalone Application, cabable of processing every Journal-Entry for Elite Dangerous.  

This Project is combinded with an API-Service and at the moment only in use by the [UGC](united-german-commander.de), all functionallity is mainly designed for their demands.    
Nethertheless in the future this Application should be used by every Squadron or Community to benefit from its features.  
Squdarons could simply:
- Track their BGS activity
- Track their Fleet Carrier
- Plan, announce and View every Carrier Jump
- Use Discord-Bots for Data Viewing
- Use Charts for BGS overview
- Do more awesome stuff that will be possible!

At the moment the UGC App is used to Output a Route, relative to the CMDr, for BGS relevant Systems.
Including an Overlay, to display the major Information in the Mainscreen while Elite Dangerous is runnig.

Again, at the moment the main functionallity is mainly designed for the UGC, future Plans are common use cases!
