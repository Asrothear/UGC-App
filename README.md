# UGC-App
 
This is the successor of the EDMC Plugin "UGC Plugin"  
The UGC App is a Standalone Application, cabable of processing every Journal-Entry for Elite Dangerous.  
This Project is at the moment only in use by the [UGC](united-german-commander.de), all functionallity is mainly designed for their demands.  
Nethertheless in the future this Application should be used by every Squadron or Community to benefit from its features.  
Squdarons could simply:
- Track their BGS activity
- Track their Fleet Carrier
- Plan, announce and View every Carrier Jump
- Use Discord-Bots for Data Viewing
- Use Charts for BGS overview
- Do more awesome stuff that will be possible!
